      <h2>My Interest</h2>

      <p>
        Hey, I’m Indradip Barua! I’m all about staying active – badminton is my
        go-to sport, and I’m always up for a game to sharpen my skills. At my
        free time, I play GTA 5 and Vigor. Whether I’m causing chaos in Los
        Santos, Killing innocent people with my car and my ar or surviving
        intense battles. I enjoy the mix of adrenaline and strategy in both
        sports and gaming. It’s all about finding that perfect balance, and I
        love connecting with others who are into the same things!

      <h2>My Ambition</h2>

      <p>
        I’m passionate about becoming a pilot in the future. Flying has always
        fascinated me, and I’ve dreamed of the day I can navigate the skies
        professionally. To reach this goal, I’m working hard to gain the
        necessary skills and knowledge, focusing on both academics and hands-on
        experience. The idea of being able to travel the world, see different
        places, and experience new cultures excites me. I also love the
        responsibility that comes with being a pilot, as safety and precision
        are key in aviation. I plan to start with pilot training and eventually
        earn the certifications needed to fly commercial flights. Along the way,
        I’m dedicated to learning everything I can to be the best I can be in
        this field. It’s a challenging career, but I’m determined to work hard
        and make my dream of becoming a pilot a reality. There are gqmes like
        MFSW, DCS world where i can learn about planes through my monitor.
